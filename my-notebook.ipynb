    "# Step 1: Brief description of the problem and data\n",
    "In this Kaggle competition project, the task is to build a GAN (generative adversarial network) that generates 7,000 to 10,000 Monet-style images.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Kaggle:\n",
    "The dataset contains four directories: `monet_tfrec`, `photo_tfrec`, `monet_jpg`, and `photo_jpg`. The `monet_tfrec` and `monet_jpg` directories contain the same painting images, and the `photo_tfrec` and `photo_jpg` directories contain the same photos.\n",
    "* The `monet` directories contain Monet paintings. Use these images to train your model.\n",
    "* The `photo` directories contain photos. Add Monet-style to these images and submit your generated jpeg images as a zip file. Other photos outside of this dataset can be transformed but keep your submission file limited to 10,000 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Monet-style art can be created from scratch using other GAN architectures like DCGAN. The submitted image files do not necessarily have to be transformed photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle describes the files provided as follows:\n",
    "* **monet_jpg** - 300 Monet paintings sized 256x256 in JPEG format\n",
    "* **monet_tfrec** - 300 Monet paintings sized 256x256 in TFRecord format\n",
    "* **photo_jpg** - 7028 photos sized 256x256 in JPEG format\n",
    "* **photo_tfrec** - 7028 photos sized 256x256 in TFRecord format\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this project must be called `images.zip` and contain 7,000 to 10,000 images sized 256x256."
